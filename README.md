# MERN Eats 🍔🍕🌮 (Portfolio Project)

Hey there! 👋 MERN Eats is a **personal portfolio project** showcasing a full-stack food ordering application. Think of it as a fun demo built with the MERN stack, connecting fictional users with imaginary (but tasty-looking!) eateries using **dummy data**. 🍕

**✨ Check out the Live Demo! ✨** ➡️ [https://mern-food-ordering-app-frontend-f351.onrender.com/](https://mern-food-ordering-app-frontend-f351.onrender.com/)

It simulates the experience of finding restaurants, ordering food, and tracking deliveries.

## What's Cooking in the Demo? 🧑‍🍳

**Simulated User Experience:**

* 🏙️ **Explore:** Browse a list of fictional restaurants in a sample city.
* 🍜 **Filter:** Practice filtering restaurants by different cuisine types.
